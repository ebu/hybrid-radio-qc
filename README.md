# hybrid-radio-qc
A set of Quality Control (QC) checks for RadioDNS Hybrid Radio metadata

The goal of this project is to provide a number of simple and easily-integrateable unit tests for performing quality control on RadioDNS Hybrid Radio data, including:

* Service and Programme Information (ETSI TS 102 818)
* Slideshow (ETSI TS 101 499)

The tests cover whether there is any missing data (e.g. Project Logo for SPI) and makes judgements on the quality of the data.
